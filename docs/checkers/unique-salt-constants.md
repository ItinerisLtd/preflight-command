> In simple terms, a secret key is a password with elements that make it harder to generate enough options to break through your security barriers. A password like "password" or "test" is simple and easily broken. A random, long password which uses no dictionary words, such as "88a7da62429ba6ad3cb3c76a09641fc" would take a brute force attacker millions of hours to crack. A 'salt is used to further enhance the security of the generated result.
